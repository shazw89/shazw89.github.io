My very first project was a simple memory game with a bit of a Japanese twist. I wanted to learn the basics of Javascript by building a straightforward game, but I also wanted it to stand out thematically. Hence the pounding Ukiyo-e waves in the backdrop.

I used: Vanilla Javascript, HTML5, CSS, Heroku, Github
